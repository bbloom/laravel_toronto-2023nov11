7:00pm - 9:00pm - presentations, round tables

Thank you to David who worked hard to arrange this meet-up. And, a big thank you to Maple for hosting our meet-up, and for sponsoring a bit of food and drink for us as well.

Having done an involved PHP serverless presentation earlier this month for GTA PHP, and David having done a fantastic presentation at Maple's first hosted meet-up in the fall, let's have other's present. Although, there is one (maybe two) Laravel related follow-ups to show you, with real code.

I am interested in your experience with running jobs, and with queues. And in your experience with PEST and LaraStan. And perhaps if anyone is familiar with Laravel's Dusk, versus using Cypress.
